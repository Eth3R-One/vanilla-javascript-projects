# Vanilla JavaScript Projects

While practicting JavaScript, I created a few projects using vanilla JavaScript. These projects are listed below:

## Projects

- [Reviews template](https://github.com/Eth3R-One/vanilla-javascript-projects/tree/main/reviews)
- [Menu with category filter](https://github.com/Eth3R-One/vanilla-javascript-projects/tree/main/menu-filter)

## Reviews template

This project is a template for a reviews section. It uses a JavaScript array to store the reviews and a function to display the reviews. The function uses the array to display the reviews. The function also uses a random number generator to display a random review when the page is loaded or the button is clicked.

## Menu with category filter

This project is a menu with a category filter. It uses a JavaScript array to store the menu items and a function to display the menu items. The function uses the array to display the menu items. The function also uses a filter to display the menu items based on the category selected.

This project is based on the [Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=2644s) by John Smilga on Youtube.
